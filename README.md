Intraday Trading Strategies for Stock Markets Using Clustering and Differential Evolution

Abstract
This work presents a data science approach to provide a stock trading strategy based
on behavioral trends. Creating an intraday trading strategy, treating each daily behavior
as an individual and clustering based on its time series using a hierarchical clustering 
algorithm. Also a differential evolution was used to perform an intensification search in 
promising regions and adjust the borders regions parameters by the proposed model of this 
research. The main challenge for application in an emerging market are the creation of an 
adaptive strategy due to the high volatility of external factors, a wide range of results 
are generated to evaluate the strategy. Excellent results were obtained, mainly regarding 
the returns normality, tests were performed over a period of three years, presenting better 
results than Buy-\&-Hold and with a very reduced drawdown, therefore this strategy can be 
used as leverage. Thus, allowing for an investment greater than the monetary value of the 
invested capital.
